      <p class="why-par-1">
        We believe in a <span>waste-free environment </span>through social change until it
        becomes a habit nurturing a healthy generation. We plan to achieve this
        by recruiting a team in every district in our beloved Jeddah city.
        <br>
         We
        are a family of friends and colleagues grouped by self-motivation and
        passion sharing common values and beliefs that treasure the environment,
        prioritizing it every step of the way. We made running more effective as
        a promising sport. By adding purpose to our running habit we found out
        that we are running much more and we are enjoying it. Running is more
        fun now while collecting trash because we are making sure not to leave
        any trace behind us and making our environment a better place too.
        <br> As a
        result, within a short period, we recruited 100+ members and the numbers
        are rapidly growing. It is an amazing sign that we are on the right
        track!

      <p class="why-par-2">
        <strong>Note:</strong>  To cater for different fitness levels across the Jeddah community,
        some of us jog but the majority walks. We walk and collect on the go and
        are always encouraging for some jogging to eventually get to the jogging
        level.<br>
         Plogging is a sustainable activity that merges physical activity
        with caring for the environment. It is sustainable since it is simple,
        fun, and is linked to well-defined rigid environmental and moral
        purposes. It also satisfies the 2030 vision to develop eco-friendly
        practices that can lessen our load on the environment as well as boost
        the tourism sector. 
        <br>Tourism can not be built without a decent
        environment or a habit of keeping it clean.

      <p  class="inception-par">It
           first saw the light as a movement in Sweden, where a group of people started picking up garbage as they were jogging –
            caring for the environment on the move, and ever since then it has grown phenomenally and has expanded worldwide through 
            USA, Mexico, Scotland and now Saudi Arabia!
            <br>
            Plogging is hence the term given to the act of picking up garbage while jogging 
            - 
          derived from the Swedish term "plocka upp" which means pick up.</p>

    <h2 class="idea-header">The Idea</h2>
    <p class="idea-par1">
        Because plogging combines running/walking with the environmental dimension in mind, 
        it follows a route. It is not a clean-up activity per say in a sense that we have to 
        clean everything in a defined fixed spot. It is more of a mobile activity that allows us to pickup garbage 
        “on the go” moving from one spot to the other until we get to a particular destination or cover a certain distance.
         This also means that we can not really clean everything around us because we are always on the move.
        Plogging is a balance between the environment and physical activity. 
        <br>
        Therefore, a plogging session usually starts with defining the route from a particular meeting point for everyone to 
        follow at their own pace. Thanks to Napco and Sanita, the biggest paper packaging company in the Middle East, they are 
        sponsoring us with all the gear that we need. Gear is distributed which includes biodegradable garbage bags, heavy-duty
         rubber reusable gloves, BPA-free plastic water bottles, trail bags, as well as t-shirts for men and vests for women.
          At this point, a segregation manual is presented where ploggers are encouraged to split into groups to segregate the
           waste collected into recyclables like Plastic, Paper, Metal, and Glass. The segregation habit helps not only build a
            new habit within households but to also facilitate the recycling process of the solid waste collected. The collected
             segregated waste is then sent to
        recycling facilities to encourage a circular economy.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p class="idea-par2">
        It is vital for us to mention that we no longer use the term “waste” to describe our recyclables because 
        of its lost value that we are not even considering or noticing. We strongly believe that plastic for instance can
        be first reused effectively in many ways before throwing it away in addition to the option of recycling it which
            sustains our natural resources and embodied energy which could be retrieved into fuel production by the process of pyrolysis.
        Hence we replaced garbage or waste with the newly refurbished term “THE LOST GOLD”!
        <br>
        To guarantee our sustainability of our plogs, we maintain opting for dynamic crowded areas where most people
        perform their daily sports and exercises. This helps us send out a clear message of what we are trying to do and make
        sure the message sinks in raising the awareness we need. We also offer a variety of events. These include habit-introducing
        mpetitions, in-city plogs (district plogging), remote plogs (outside Jeddah in the form of trips), and collaborative events 
        with existing groups/organisations such as Hejaz Ultra, Blissrunners, JRC, the British international school (BISJ), 
        and the Rawda Community Center.

        Our latest activity that was added to our plogging activity involves gathering statistical data through the use
        of brand audits for mainly plastic products. Brand auditors walk alongside ploggers and quantify both the types and 
        number of plastic items found. These brand audits are then sent to our affiliate worldwide organisation which we are 
        proudly a member of – breakfreefromplastic – to put pressure on international manufacturers of plastic to reinvent 
        eco-friendly
        alternatives to plastic as means for safe packaging.
